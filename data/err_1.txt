Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing in order to express my disappointment about your musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I saws the show 's advertisement hanging up of a wall in London where I was spending my holiday with some friends . I convinced them to go there with me because I had heard good references about your Company and , above all , about the main star , Danny Brook .
The problems started in the box office , where we asked for the discounts you announced in the advertisement , and the man who was selling the tickets said that they did n't exist .
Moreover , the show was delayed forty - five minutes and the worst of all was that Danny Brook had been replaced by another actor .
On the other hand , the theatre restaurant was closed because unknown reasons .
You promised a perfect evening but it became a big disastrous !
I would like some kind of explanation and receive my money back .
If you do n't agree , I will act consequently .
I look forward to hearing from you .
